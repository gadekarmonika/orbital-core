Python Language and Library Support
===================================

Python Language Version
***********************

Orbital-core is designed to be a strongly opinionated ecosystem, which also
includes the version of Python that should be used. This is designed to prevent
backwards-incompatible changes from being added in and breaking the ecosystem.

Orbital-core is designed to support a specific version of Python (3.7 at the
time of this writing), but it is not enforced.

Library Versions
****************

Libraries of services are intended to be enforced in the future, for similar reasons
as the version of Python.
