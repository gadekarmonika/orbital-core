Developing Applications Based on Orbital-Core
=============================================

Seeing all Available Tasks
**************************

Orbital-Core applications are based on Uranium. As such, you can list
all available build tasks using ``./uranium --tasks``.

The basic workflow is:

* ``./uranium`` to install dependencies and build the services
* ``./uranium test`` to execute unit tests
* ``./uranium dev`` to start the service in development mode.
